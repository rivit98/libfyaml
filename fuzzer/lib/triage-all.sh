#   ./fuzz triage-all                   # the campaign's crashes, then its hangs

#
# find lists the artifacts, xargs -P runs them: every replay is
# `./fuzz triage --with <variant> <artifact>` in a child process, so the
# sanitizer options, the log format and the atomic write live in triage.sh
# alone and cannot drift from a hand-run triage; the variant list and the log
# names come from common.sh, which both of them read. Nothing here reads a log,
# or even what a replay exited with: the logs in $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR - $LOG_DIR, or
# ${LOG_DIR}_<TC> with TC set - are the product, for whatever processes them
# afterwards. The status line counts replays, nothing else.
#
# One replay is one artifact under one variant. Not one artifact at a time:
# triage.sh replays an artifact's variants in parallel and then waits for all
# of them, so every artifact would cost its slowest variant - an MSAN run, or
# a hang that holds its core for the full --timeout - while the other cores sat
# idle. Handed to xargs one pair at a time, the replays keep every -j slot busy
# until the list runs out.
#
# Written for the machine that is fuzzing, next to a live campaign: every
# replay runs under nice -n 19, which leaves the lanes their CPU however many
# of them run. Under FUZZ_BACKEND=docker that nice level stays with the docker
# client and does not reach the container - lower -j there.
#
# Every log stays, whatever its replay did: sanitizer reports, crashes, leaks,
# timeouts, replays that failed to start - and the clean ones, which are the
# answer "this artifact does nothing under this sanitizer" and take a replay to
# get back. $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR is then the whole sweep, and what reads it decides
# what a clean log means. ./fuzz clean logs is what empties it.
#
# Resumable: triage.sh writes each log atomically, and a replay whose log is
# there is dropped before xargs starts, so an interrupted sweep continues where
# it stopped, and a sweep repeated after new crashes have landed replays only
# the new ones.

USAGE="usage: $PROG triage-all [-j N] [--with v1,v2] [--timeout S] [--hang-limit N] [DIR...]

  -j N            replays to run at once, xargs -P (default: \$JOBS, one per
                  physical core - $JOBS here)
  --with a,b      variants to replay (default: every built one of asan, msan,
                  lsan, fast)
  --timeout S     per-replay wall clock, passed to ./fuzz triage
  --hang-limit N  hangs to take per instance, evenly spaced through the sorted
                  directory (default: 5; 0 takes every hang)
  DIR...          triage every file in these directories instead of the
                  campaign's - a flat directory from ./fuzz grab, say. Taken in
                  full: --hang-limit applies only to a campaign's hangs/.

Replays every crash of \$OUT_DIR/<instance>/crashes, then a sample of every
\$OUT_DIR/<instance>/hangs, through ./fuzz triage - one artifact under one
variant per replay, -j replays at a time through xargs -P, each at nice -n 19
so a running campaign keeps its cores. FUZZ_GROUP picks the campaign, as everywhere else.

Prints one status line - replays done out of the total and the rate - rewritten
in place on a terminal and written once a minute to a file or a pipe. No
verdict: not even a count of what the replays reported. The logs are the
product, and reading them is another tool's job. They go to \$LOG_DIR, or to
\${LOG_DIR}_<TC> when TC is set - here: $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR. A replay whose log
exists is skipped before anything starts, so an interrupted sweep resumes.

Every replay leaves its log there, the clean ones (exit 0) included: nothing is
removed afterwards, and ./fuzz clean logs is what empties the directory.

A sample, not every hang, because a campaign saves far more hangs than crashes
(AFL++ stops at 512 per instance) and a replay of one costs the full timeout.
--hang-limit 0 when you want them all."
