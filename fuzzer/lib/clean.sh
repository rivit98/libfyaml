# A target named on its own is the current campaign's: $OUT_DIR and
# $CONTAINER_PREFIX follow FUZZ_GROUP (state/<group>, or state/all without
# one). --all is every campaign's - the whole of $CAMPAIGN_DIR/state, every
# group's crashes and containers - because a campaign run with FUZZ_GROUP=yaml
# lives in state/yaml, and an --all that followed FUZZ_GROUP removed state/all
# alone and left every grouped campaign behind, crashes and queues included.
#
# Targets:
#   builds     fuzzer/build/*            every variant, rebuilt by `build`
#   logs       $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR           triage replays: $LOG_DIR, or
#                                        ${LOG_DIR}_<TC> with TC set; --all
#                                        takes every one of them
#   state      $OUT_DIR                  the AFL queues - ends any resume
#   crashes    the crashes/ and hangs/ dirs inside $OUT_DIR  - FINDINGS
#   containers leftover $CONTAINER_PREFIX-* docker containers
#
# Seeds and coverage output are not targets.
# crashes before state: under --all, state takes every crash with it, and the
# crashes - the one target that is findings - should be what the log reports.

USAGE="usage: $PROG clean --all | <target>...

  <target>...    exactly these, of the current campaign
  --all          every target of every campaign, crashes included

Targets:
  builds      fuzzer/build/*    every variant, rebuilt by 'build'
  logs        \$LOG_DIR          triage replays - \${LOG_DIR}_<TC> with TC set
  state       \$OUT_DIR          the AFL queues - ends any resume
  crashes     the crashes/ and hangs/ dirs inside \$OUT_DIR - FINDINGS
  containers  leftover $CONTAINER_PREFIX-* docker containers

Without a target nothing is removed. A target named on its own is the current
campaign's - FUZZ_GROUP picks it (state/<group>, or state/all without one), and
TC the logs; --all takes the logs of every TC and the state, crashes and
containers of every campaign. state and crashes
are refused while a campaign is running - with --all, while any campaign is.
Seeds and coverage output are not targets."
