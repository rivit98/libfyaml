# Replay one artifact through the sanitizer builds, one log per build. The
# command prints progress only - it reaches no verdict about what the replays
# reported. The logs in $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR are the product: reading them is
# src/fuzz/CLAUDE.md's job, and ./fuzz triage-all sweeps a whole campaign into
# them for whatever processes them afterwards.
#
#   ./fuzz triage <artifact>                     # every built variant
#   ./fuzz triage --with asan,msan <artifact>    # only these
#   ./fuzz triage --timeout 300 <artifact>       # per-replay limit (default: 20 s)
#
# The artifact is always the last argument: a crash, a hang, or any input file.
#
# An artifact is replayed under every sanitizer, not just the one that found
# it: the lane that saved it is whichever lane happened to hit the input first,
# and the same input often reports differently (or not at all) under another
# sanitizer.
#
# Only asan, msan, lsan and fast are replayed by default: cmplog exists to be
# passed to afl-fuzz -c, cov and laf carry no sanitizer, and the sand-* oracles
# are asan/msan without an edge map.
#
# Log: $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR/[<lane>__]<artifact>__<variant>.log - the directory is
# $LOG_DIR, or ${LOG_DIR}_<TC> when TC is set (logs/, logs_test_yaml/), the
# lane only for an artifact that sits in a campaign's
# <lane>/{crashes,hangs,queue}/ - each one headed by the artifact path, the
# variant and the sanitizer options it ran with. A log is written to .tmp and
# renamed when the replay finishes, and a variant whose log is already there is
# skipped, so a sweep over thousands of artifacts resumes exactly.
#
# VERBOSE, when set, reaches the harness: the log then also shows
# "=== Running <test> ===" and a timing line per test case (for a hang, the
# last Running line without a timing line is the test case that hangs),
# "allocation N failed (injected)" when the crash rides on an injected
# allocation failure, and the decoded flag seed.
#
# TRIAGE_PROGRESS, when set (triage-all sets it), trades the "replaying ..."
# lines for one "@@triage <variant> <exit status>" line per replay on stdout -
# "logged" instead of the status for a variant whose log was already there -
# which triage-all counts into its status line.

USAGE="usage: $PROG triage [--with v1,v2] [--timeout S] <artifact>

  <artifact>    the file to replay - a crash, a hang, any input; always last
  --with a,b    only these variants, each of which must be built already
                (default: every built one of the four)
  --timeout S   per-replay wall clock, default 20 s
                (each replay also runs with a 4 MB stack: ulimit -s 4096)

Replays the artifact through asan, msan, lsan and fast at once, one log per
variant, and prints only what it is replaying: no verdict is reached here.
cmplog, cov, laf and the sand-* oracles are not replayed by default - cmplog
exists for afl-fuzz -c, cov and laf carry no sanitizer, and the oracles are
asan/msan without an edge map.

Full output per replay:
<logs>/[<lane>__]<artifact>__<variant>.log - <logs> is \$LOG_DIR, or
\${LOG_DIR}_<TC> when TC is set (here: $TRIAGE_LOG_DIR), the <lane>__ prefix
only for an artifact inside a campaign's <lane>/{crashes,hangs,queue}/, whose
name is unique only there. A variant whose log already exists is skipped. With
VERBOSE set the log also names each test case as it runs, its timing and any
injected allocation failure - the way to tell which test case a hang is stuck
in.

Every crash and hang of a campaign, every variant of each replayed in
parallel: ./fuzz triage-all"
